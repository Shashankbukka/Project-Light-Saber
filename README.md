# Description and diffculties faced
Final project for the gfg course, implementing the trail and particle effects for a light saber
This project was built to understand and implement a Trail effect for a Light saber instance.

For implementing the specific project through material editor or C++ made us face a lot of problems.

The code base took us to another level in the implementation causing numerous issues during development.

As we could not implement it through code, we started implementing the project through blueprints.

We have successfully increased the complexity of the project by implementing various functionalities to a simple project.

# Functionalities:
1) Third Person Character with various attack animations.
2) A light saber mesh created from scratch. Light saber holder created through mesh lab and the mesh for the emissive material created through object code written by hand.
3) Implemented particle effects and leave imprints when colliding with another mesh.
4) Implemented a smooth trail effect for the light saber upon various attack animations.
5) Provided a menu for changing the quality settings of the project.
6) Spawn the light saber like in the movies on pressing a key.
7) Changing color of the light saber by pressing a key.
